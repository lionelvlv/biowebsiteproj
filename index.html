        <p>
            In addition, you can find the navigation at the bottom of this page, where you can find the quiz, bibliography, and source code (Github) for this project.
        </p>
        <p> 
            As for the website's content, I've picked out five frogs that are native to California that I thought looked cool for this project.
            Why Frogs you may ask? While originally I wanted to do a website on California's natural landscapes, I decided to go with frogs because my girlfriend thinks they are cute. I also wanted to learn more about them, and I thought it would be a fun topic to explore.  
        </p>

        <p>
            That being said, each frog has a profile, with facts about its habitat, diet, and notable features. In addition, I've included a link to a YouTube video of each frog's mating call.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            So, whether you're here to learn, explore, or play the quiz, I invite you to hop along on this educational adventure. Discover the hidden world of California's frogs, understand their role in our ecosystem, and maybe even find your new favorite amphibian!
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope you enjoy exploring the site as much as I enjoyed creating it. Feel free to test your knowledge on the quiz below. All the information you need for the quiz is on this page.
            Happy hopping!

            <p>The California Red-legged Frog, known for its distinctive red underside and powerful legs, is a true icon of the Western United States. Thriving in wetlands and streams, its diet primarily consists of insects and worms. This species holds a special place in American literature, having inspired Mark Twain's famed story "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County." Once abundant, these frogs have faced challenges due to habitat loss but remain a symbol of California's diverse wildlife. Their remarkable leaping ability and unique coloration make them a fascinating subject for nature enthusiasts.

            <p>The Foothill Yellow-legged Frog, predominantly found in California's streams and rivers, is an intriguing amphibian. It primarily feeds on insects and plays a vital role in the riverine ecosystem. This species is particularly known for its sensitivity to changes in water flow and quality, making it an indicator of environmental health. The breeding of the Foothill Yellow-legged Frog is closely tied to seasonal rains, showcasing their unique adaptation to local climatic conditions. Conservation efforts are crucial for this species, as alterations to their natural habitats pose significant threats to their populations.

            <p>The Sierra Nevada Yellow-legged Frog, a high-altitude dweller in California's mountain lakes, has garnered attention for its endangered status. These frogs primarily consume insects and have evolved unique breeding cycles adapted to their alpine environments. Once prevalent across the Sierra Nevada, they have faced significant challenges due to habitat loss and disease. Conservation efforts are increasingly important for this species, highlighting the need for environmental stewardship. Their story is a compelling example of how even seemingly remote species are impacted by broader ecological changes.

            <p>The Arroyo Toad, a nocturnal species, is most commonly found in California's coastal streams. These toads are known for their unique sand-burrowing behavior, which they use as a daytime refuge. Their diet consists mainly of insects, and they play an important role in controlling insect populations in their habitats. The Arroyo Toad has a distinctive life cycle and reproductive pattern, relying on the sandy and gravelly banks of streams for breeding. Their existence highlights the delicate balance in aquatic ecosystems and the importance of preserving natural stream environments.

            <p>The Pacific Tree Frog, known for its versatility, inhabits a range of environments including forests, grasslands, and urban areas. This small but vocal amphibian's diet consists of insects and spiders, contributing to insect population control. A remarkable feature of the Pacific Tree Frog is its ability to change skin color, aiding in camouflage. During mating season, their loud chorus calls are a familiar sound in wetlands, signaling their presence. This adaptability to various habitats and conditions showcases the frog's resilience and the importance of preserving diverse ecosystems for species survival.
